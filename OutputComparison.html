<p>The algorithm (Algorithm WS) implements following aesthetics while drawing binary trees.</p>
<p><ul><u><b>Aesthetic-1</b></u></ul></p>
<p><ul>Nodes of a tree at the same height should lie along a straight line, and the straight lines defining the levels should be parallel.</ul></p>
<p><ul><u><b>Aesthetic-2</b></u></ul></p>
<p><ul>In a binary tree, each left son should be positioned left of its father and each right son right of its father.</ul></p>
<p><ul><u><b>Aesthetic-3</b></u></ul></p>
</p><ul>A parent should be centered over its children.</ul></p>
<p>This algorithm doesn't always meet the physical limit.</p>

<p>As our example illustrates, the difficulty with Algorithm WS is that symmetric trees may be drawn asymmetrically, or more generally, a tree
and its reflection will not always produce mirror image drawings; even the same subtree may appear differently in different parts of the tree.</p>

<p><b><u>EDWARD M.REINGOLD and JOHN S. TILFORD</u></b></p>
<p>The algorithm (Algorithm TR) implements following aesthetics while drawing binary trees.</p>
<p><ul><u><b>Aesthetic-1</b></u></ul></p>
<p><ul>Nodes of a tree at the same height should lie along a straight line, and the straight lines defining the levels should be parallel.</ul></p>
<p><ul><u><b>Aesthetic-2</b></u></ul></p>
<p><ul>In a binary tree, each left son should be positioned left of its father and each right son right of its father.</ul></p>
<p><ul><u><b>Aesthetic-3</b></u></ul></p>
</p><ul>A parent should be centered over its children.</ul></p>
<p><ul><u><b>Aesthetic-4</b></u></ul></p>
</p><ul>A tree and its mirror image should produce drawings that are reflections of one another; moreover, a sub-tree should be drawn the same way regardless of where it occurs in the tree.</ul></p>
<p>We consider Aesthetic 4 to be more important than minimum width since the shape of the printed tree and its reflection ought to be independent of its surroundings to aid in human perception.</p>
