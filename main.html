<p><b>I. Added functionalities</b></p>

<p><ol>Pressing F1 takes the output screen -> fullscreen.</ol></p>
<p><ul>Pressing esc quits the program.</ul></p>
<p><ul>Inputs can be given on the screen itself, by simply typing.</ul></p>
<p><ul>Backspace functionality is supported as well.</ul></p>
<p><ul>Pressing 'Enter' inputs the data.</ul></p>
<p><ul>The data is outputted live, on the screen,</ul></p>

<p><b>II. Python script and graph generation</b></p>
<p>A python file has been attached below, which has been used to input the file generated by the (modified)C program, to draw the graphs of the algorithms. All the x coordinates of the graph, (taken input from the file), is stored in an array, and similarly; the y coordinates as well. A simple plot() function, takes as parameters, all the (x,y) points, and plots them as a continuous function in 2D space.</p>
<p>The files for memory analysis, time analysis, the modified C code for achieving the same, and the corresponding I/O files have been put below.</p>
